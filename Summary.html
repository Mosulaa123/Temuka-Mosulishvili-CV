<h1>Summery</h1>
<hr><hr>
<p>
    Currently employed by the GPB (Georgian public broadcaster), managing a streaming app 1TVPLAY and a number of new initiatives and projects.<br> 
    These projects mainly focus on capturing a younger demographic through a dedicated team of content creators.<br>
    Along with managing new projects and initiatives I host a weekly podcast and a segment on GPB's morning show <br>on subjects ranging from blockchain and AI to what is public service media? and who owns the oceans?
    <br>I have a joint bachelor's degree in Amsterdam between Wittenborg University and Brighton University, <br>worked at Colliers International in the Data Center, on some of the biggest development projects in the country.
    <br>Very passionate and interested in a vast array of subjects ranging from business to science, politics and many more.

    You will probably notice that this summery has little to do with coding, the reason is simple i'm just getting into this field and i hope i will stick around.
    <br> Nevertheless my goal is not to learn coding, it is to better manage IT Projects, if i get into coding that is simply a pleasnet byproduct of my endevour.
</p>
<p>
    To make it short the most important thing one should know about me is that i never give up, always try to move forward and have values which i will never cross.
